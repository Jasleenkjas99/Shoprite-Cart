##  I have  build a Shopping Cart with JavaScript. This JavaScript shopping cart will enable items to be added to the cart, as items are being added the price of all the items is being recorded. We can also increase or decrease the quantity of a particular item in the shopping cart. As we decrease or increase the quantity of an item, the item's price also gets updated.
